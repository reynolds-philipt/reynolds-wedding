								I knew that to ask her it to be just right and had got an idea that I should ask her on a beach in a different country.  She had never been out of the country before and I wanted to be the one to take her on that adventure.  She brought up the idea of taking a trip after her graduation before I could ask her if she wanted to, which helped to hide my plan of the proposal from the start.  She even suggested that we do at least one night where we do a nicer dinner and get dressed up for it which was exactly what I was thinking with a slight twist.  The resort had a buffet cafeteria for every meal and a restaurant on the beach that you had to make reservations at and we decided to have our nice dinner date on Monday night.  We went to the concierge that day to set up our reservations and were a little disappointed we could only get reservations for 8:30PM, though I knew I was going to go back and change the reservation.  Happy with our reservations and ready to enjoy the sunshine we went straight to the beach.

								Her Story: The Proposal
							</h2>
							<p class="paragraph_story">
								It happened in May of 2017. We were in the Dominican Republic taking our first real vacation together - we were celebrating how we were both officially done with college. On that special day, we had made reservations at one of the resort's restaurants. Later on, we were both on the beach just trying to relax when Philip said that he forgot to put on sun screen. He truly did forget because his shoulders didn't have that sticky, sun screen feeling. So, he left but he was gone for roughly 45 minutes it seemed like. I was getting ready to send a search party out for him! Anyways, he came back and said that while he was going back to the room to get sun screen, the man we made reservations with for the restaurant said there were some earlier dinner openings due to cancellations and had Phil go back with him to choose a time. Dinner was then moved to 6:30pm, originally it was 8:30pm. So I was all about that, I knew I would be starving by 8:30pm. While I probably should have been more suspicious, it was an all-inclusive resort so the both of us were drinking a lot, all day every day. ANYWAYS, the night of we got ready for dinner and we're walking towards the beach, that's where the restaurant was, and we turn the corner and there is this BEAUTIFUL beach dinner table set up. I knew instantly it was Phil's doing and that that's what he was doing during the length of time he was gone earlier in the day. I started to tear up because it was so sweet! While we were eating one of the courses to our dinner, a photographer that takes pictures for the resort came up to us wanting to take our picture and I thought, "Holy cow, Phil might actually propose!" After we get done posing for a few, the photographer leaves and says we can pick up the pictures the next day. So, now I'm a little sad because I got my hopes up, but I was still wanting to enjoy this time with him because it was such a sweet gesture and a beautiful set up. While waiting for the next course, Phil asks for my phone to have someone else take pictures before the sun completely sets. He takes my phone and gives it to a restaurant worker (I didn't know this at the time, but he apparently pulled the ring out to try and explain to the man to not stop taking pictures). They both come back to the table, we take a picture and Phil asks me to check it to see if it's okay. I was confused because he knows I don't typically check my pictures because I don't care too much as to how I look in them. However, I'm glad I did because my hair was all over the place since the wind was coming from behind us. We angled ourselves differently for the next couple pictures and when I was about to get my phone back, Phil goes down on one knee. Before anything was said I was bawling my eyes out because that was easily the happiest moment of my life!!! He pulled out a ring and asked me to marry him! I didn't even get to look at the ring and I barely nodded my head because I was crying so much because I was so surprised and happy all at once! So, Phil just put the ring on my finger anyways (which I was totally fine with) and asked if I was okay and, once again, I just gave a little nod (still crying) and we hugged and kissed and sat back down at the table. I was still shocked, happy, and crying at least 5 minutes after we sat down. Eventually I was able to tell Phil that I thought the ring was absolutely beautiful! After finishing dinner, even though I couldn't really think about the food after our engagement, fireworks start going off in the resort. We aren't sure if they were set off for us or not, but we know there weren't events going on that night that would call for fireworks, so we're just saying they were for us :). 
And that's the story of the greatest night of my life!!!
